Features:

* User Registration: Allows users to register by providing necessary details like username, email, and password. Implements proper validation checks to ensure data integrity.
* Login Functionality: Users can securely log in using their registered credentials. Passwords are hashed for enhanced security.
* Secure Data Storage: Utilizes password hashing to securely store user credentials in the database.
* Efficient Database Operations: Implements structured error handling and exception management for database interactions, ensuring smooth operation even in case of failures.

Technologies Used:

* Java: Core programming language used for the backend logic.
* Java Swing: Used for building the user interface to facilitate user interaction.
* JDBC: Enables Java applications to interact with databases, facilitating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
* MySQL (Structured Query Language): Utilized for creating, updating, and querying the database schema.

Usage:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Set up your database according to the provided schema.
* Compile and run the Java application.
* Use the GUI to register new users and log in securely.


This project serves as a foundational example for building secure authentication systems in Java, emphasizing best practices in database management, error handling, and user validation.
